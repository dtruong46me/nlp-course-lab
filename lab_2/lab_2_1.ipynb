The founders\\' original purpose was to provide banking services to immigrants and local residents of lower Manhattan. As the Chinese immigrant population grew in the 1980s and 1990s, the bank retained its original mission, but expanded its size and scope. It now has six branches covering New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Besides the traditional banking services, it also offers insurance and securities through its subsidiaries. Abacus is federally chartered. Its mortgage and other services extend to all states in the United States. Abacus has a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, the Abacus Insurance Agency Corp. (AIAC), which provides life, health, accident and annuity insurance. In May 2012, New York prosecutors indicted the bank and 19 of its employees on charges of fraud in relation to hundreds of millions of dollars worth of mortgages that had been sold to Fannie Mae between 2005 and 2010. The bank was accused of falsifying loan applications so that borrowers would qualify for mortgages. Abacus has said that it uncovered the improper behavior itself, reported it to the regulator, and fired the employee in question. It also said it was not involved with the fraudulent packaging of subprime mortgage securities and had a mortgage default rate of 0.5%, a tenth of the national average. The reasonableness of the prosecution, in light of the treatment received by large banks, has been questioned by media outlets.

Duesberg (born December 2, 1936) is a German American molecular biologist and a professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley. He is known for his early research into genetic aspects of cancer, and more recently for his central role in the AIDS denialism movement as a proponent of the belief that HIV is harmless and does not cause AIDS. Duesberg received acclaim early in his career for research on oncogenes and cancer. With Peter K. Vogt, he reported in 1970 that a cancer-causing virus of birds had extra genetic material compared with non-cancer-causing viruses, hypothesizing that this material contributed to cancer. At the age of 36, Duesberg was awarded tenure at the University of California, Berkeley, and at 49 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He received an Outstanding Investigator Grant (OIG) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1986, and from 1986 to 1987 was a Fogarty Scholar-in-Residence at the NIH laboratories in Bethesda, Maryland. Long considered a contrarian by his scientific colleagues, Duesberg began to gain public notoriety with a March 1987 article in Cancer Research entitled \\\\\"Retroviruses as Carcinogens and Pathogens: Expectations and Reality\\\\\". In this and subsequent writings, Duesberg proposed his hypothesis that AIDS is caused by long-term consumption of recreational drugs or antiretroviral drugs, and that HIV is a harmless passenger virus. In contrast, the scientific consensus is that HIV infection causes AIDS; Duesberg\\'s HIV/AIDS claims have been addressed and rejected as erroneous by the scientific community. Reviews of his opinions in Nature and Science asserted that they were unpersuasive and based on selective reading of the literature, and that although Duesberg had a right to a dissenting opinion, his failure to fairly review evidence that HIV causes AIDS meant that his opinion lacked credibility. Duesberg\\'s views are cited as major influences on South African HIV/AIDS policy under the administration of Thabo Mbeki, which embraced AIDS denialism. Duesberg served on an advisory panel to Mbeki, convened in 2000. The Mbeki administration\\'s failure to provide antiretroviral drugs in a timely manner, due in part to the influence of AIDS denialism, is thought to be responsible for hundreds of thousands of preventable AIDS deaths and HIV infections in South Africa. Duesberg disputed these findings in an article in the journal Medical Hypotheses, but the journal\\'s publisher, Elsevier, later retracted Duesberg\\'s article over accuracy and ethics concerns as well as its rejection during peer review. The incident prompted several complaints to Duesberg\\'s institution, the University of California, Berkeley, which began a misconduct investigation of Duesberg in 2009. The investigation was dropped in 2010, with University officials finding \\\\\"insufficient evidence...to support a recommendation for disciplinary action.\\\\\"\\n Crisis (Swedish: Kris) is a 1946 Swedish film directed by Ingmar Bergman. The film was Bergman\\'s first feature as director and he also wrote the screenplay, based on the Danish radio play Moderhjertet (translated as The Mother Animal, A Mother\\'s Heart, The Mother Creature, and The Maternal Instinct) by Leck Fischer. The story follows a young girl living a quiet life in a small town with her foster mother. Nelly is an innocent 18-year-old becoming increasingly aware of the effect that her beauty has on the men of her little Swedish village. Ingeborg is a respectably dour woman who teaches piano to village youth and has undoubtedly sacrificed much for the sake of her foster daughter. As Nelly is on the verge of womanhood and Ingeborg is in failing health, Miss Jenny returns in her fancy hat, painted nails and trampy air of sophistication, to take her long-abandoned daughter away with her to sample the indulgent fruits of urban life. Jenny has had a rough past, involving prostitution and other scandals, but now owns a beauty salon that’s afforded her a few comforts in life, material and otherwise. Among them is a dapper mustachioed gentleman acquaintance named Jack, who follows Jenny to the village as an uninvited guest. Jenny’s purpose in visiting Nelly was to meet up with her at a charity ball, and when Jack learns about the festivities planned for that night, he’s more than happy to inject more liveliness into the affair than the village elders had in mind.\\n The Old Garden (Hangul: 오래된 정원) is a 2006 South Korean film, based on the best-selling novel of the same name by the author Hwang Sok-yong.

Neither version of the album reached the charts in the United States or the United Kingdom.

The chronological running order used for the European version of The Byrds Play Dylan was retained for all subsequent CD re-releases of the original album. In 2008, the original thirteen track version of the album was re-released with its chronological running order intact, under the augmented title of Collections: The Byrds Play Dylan.

It also included The Byrds\\' cover of \\\\\"Paths of Victory\\\\\", which had been recorded in 1990 by a reunited line-up of the band featuring original members Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris Hillman. All of the material on the 2002 edition of The Byrds Play Dylan had been previously released, either on The Byrds\\' regular albums, on their singles, as bonus tracks on their remastered CDs, or on The Byrds box set.\\n Taqdeerwala is a Hindi film (English: A Man With Awesome Fate), produced by D.

It was previously the only species in the monotypic genus Amphianthus, but it was moved to genus Gratiola after genetic analysis in 2008. It is native to the Piedmont region of the southeastern United States, with a center of distribution in Georgia. It occurs in Alabama and South Carolina as well. It is limited to granite outcrops, a high-biodiversity habitat type that is threatened by activities such as quarrying, off-road vehicles, and trash and debris dumping. It is a federally listed threatened species. Gratiola amphiantha is a petite aquatic plant which occurs in the non-Mediterranean climate vernal pools that sometimes form in the granite outcrop habitat. It is a delicate annual herb a few centimeter long with a short, threadlike stem surrounded by a rosette of tiny lance-shaped submerged leaves. Above them are a pair of slightly larger, floating leaves which are oval in shape and up to 8 millimeters (0.3 inches) long. Flowers occur in the axils of both submerged and floating leaves. Those occurring underwater are cleistogamous and do not open, and those blooming on the water\\'s surface have open five-lobed white corollas a few millimeters long. It is a fast-growing species, germinating immediately with sufficient rain and maturing to flower in 17 days. Its life cycle is quick because appropriate growing conditions occur for only a brief time at these pools. There are few other plants that grow in the vernal pools of the outcrops, except for local endemic species of Isoëtes, such as Isoetes piedmontana. Recent estimates have the number of populations around 31, and certain local populations can be quite large, with several thousand plants occupying pools and puddles in outcrop habitat in wet years. However, many granite outcrops are consumed for quarrying in the area, and this is likely the greatest threat to the species. Livestock grazing near some pools has caused eutrophication of the water, making it inhospitable for the plant. The oldest name for the species is Amphianthus pusillus,coined in 1837. D.Estes & R.L.Small wanted to transfer the species to Gratiola, but could not call it Gratiola pusilla because Willdenow had already used this name for another species. Hence the replacement name, Gratiola amphiantha.\\n Barend Mons (born 1957, The Hague) is a molecular biologist and biosemantics specialist.

It was originally credited as Luke\\'s solo album. The album included the hits \\\\\"Do the Bart\\\\\" and the title track. It was also the very first release to bear the RIAA-standard Parental Advisory warning sticker. The eponymous title single is a reference to the decision in a court case that its album As Nasty As They Wanna Be was obscene (the decision would later be overturned on appeal). Bruce Springsteen granted the group permission to interpolate his song \\\\\"Born in the U.S.A.\\\\\" for it. Displeased over the decision of Florida Governor Bob Martinez who, on being asked to examine the album, decided it was obscene and recommended local law enforcement take action against it and over the subsequent action of Broward County, Florida, sheriff Nick Navarro, who arrested local record-store owners on obscenity charges for selling the group\\'s albums and the subsequent arrest of members of the group on obscenity charges, the group included the song \\\\\"Fuck Martinez\\\\\", which also includes multiple repetitions of the phrase \\\\\"fuck Navarro\\\\\". The group found two other men with the same names, and had them sign releases, as they thought that this action would make it impossible for Martinez or Navarro to sue them.\\n Living a Dream is the third album by Welsh mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins, released on 31 October 2005, in the UK.

Designers were asked for ideas for an \\\\\"Olympic tower\\\\\" at least 100 metres (330 ft) high, and Orbit was the unanimous choice from proposals considered by a . Kapoor and Balmond believed that Orbit represented a radical advance in the architectural field of combining sculpture and structural engineering, and that it combined both stability and instability in a work that visitors can engage with and experience via an incorporated spiral walkway. It has been both praised and criticised for its bold design, and has especially received criticism as a vanity project of questionable lasting use or merit as a public art project. The project was expected to cost £19.1 million, with £16 million coming from Britain\\'s richest man, the steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman of the ArcelorMittal steel company, and the balance of £3.1 million coming from the London Development Agency. The name \\\\\"ArcelorMittal Orbit\\\\\" combines the name of Mittal\\'s company, as chief sponsor, with \\\\\"Orbit\\\\\", the original working title for Kapoor and Balmond\\'s design. The ArcelorMittal Orbit closed after the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, while the South Plaza area of the Park (in which Orbit is positioned) underwent reconstruction for its long-term legacy use as a public outdoor space. It re-opened to the public on 5 April 2014. The structure is being modified to incorporate the world\\'s tallest and longest (178 metres) tunnel slide, designed by Carsten Höller. The idea was originally envisioned by the London Legacy Development Corporation as a way to attract more visitors to the tower. The slide, which will incorporate transparent sections to give a \\\\\"different perspective\\\\\" of the twisting red tower, was completed in June 2016 and will cost £17 a ride rather than the projected £5. This follows an option to abseil down the tower, which was introduced in 2014.\\n Routine Love Story is a 2012 Telugu film starring Sundeep Kishan and Regina Cassandra.

It is endemic to the Philippine island of Panay, particularly the mountains of Antique and Iloilo provinces. This is the second species recorded from the island of Panay.

The species are ecological dominants in many temperate forests in these regions. Some species are reportedly naturalised in Germany and Great Britain. The genus has a rich fossil record of leaves, cupules and pollen, with fossils extending into the late Cretaceous and occurring in Australia, New Zealand, Antarctica and South America. In the past, they were included in the family Fagaceae, but genetic tests revealed them to be genetically distinct, and they are now included in their own family, the Nothofagaceae (literally meaning \\\\\"false beeches\\\\\" or \\\\\"bastard beeches\\\\\"). The leaves are toothed or entire, evergreen or deciduous. The fruit is a small, flattened or triangular nut, borne in cupules containing one to seven nuts. Nothofagus species are used as food plants by the larvae of hepialid moths of the genus Aenetus, including A. eximia and A. virescens. Many individual trees are extremely old, and at one time, some populations were thought to be unable to reproduce in present-day conditions where they were growing, except by suckering (clonal reproduction), being remnant forest from a cooler time. Sexual reproduction has since been shown to be possible. Although the genus now mostly occurs in cool, isolated, high-altitude environments at temperate and tropical latitudes the fossil record shows that it survived in climates that appear to be much warmer than those that Nothofagus now occupies.\\n The South Superior Union Hall was built in 1921 in the southern part of what is now Superior, Wyoming.

In 1955 he married Ann Sheppard in Cardiff and had a son and daughter. He joined the Theoretical Physics Division at AERE Harwell in 1954, succeeding Brian Flowers as Head of that Division in 1960 and becoming Director of AERE in 1968; he eventually was appointed Chairman of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority in 1981. Appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1973, he was Knighted in 1982. As a champion of nuclear power, he was appointed, in 1983, to be chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board. For his success in keeping the country’s “lights on” during the protracted miners’ strike of 1984-5, Mrs Thatcher rewarded him with a life peerage and he became Baron Marshall of Goring, of South Stoke in the County of Oxfordshire on 22 July 1985. In 1989, with the government’s plan to reorganise and privatise electricity generation, the position of Chairman of the CEGB disappeared. He was made Chairman of National Power which included a large number of the coal- and oil-fired power stations and all of the nuclear power stations. National Power was a division of the CEGB until it was privatised in 1990. This was done as he had a close association with nuclear power, from the early years. But before the privatisation process was complete, the city was not happy with the nuclear component in National Power, and it was removed from the process and placed into another state-owned company (only to be part privatised some 5 years later). It was as a result of this political decision that he resigned his post as Chairman of National Power. Marshall then entered into several jobs in the private sector connected with the nuclear industry and died in 1996. As a scientist, Marshall was recognised as one of the leading theoreticians in the atomic properties of matter and characterised by his penetrating analytical powers. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1971. In 1977 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences.\\n Song for America is the second studio album by American progressive rock band Kansas, released in 1975.

It was designed by Conde McCullough and opened in 1931. The bridge has a total length of 180 ft (55 m) and contains one 120 ft (37 m) reinforced concrete tied arch, identical in design to Ten Mile Creek Bridge and Wilson River Bridge. The locations for all three bridges were similar in that the sandy foundations were not secure enough for the abutment piers required to relieve the lateral pressure of traditional arches. The flood levels of the rivers approached the road grade and ruled out the use of reinforced concrete girders. The corrosive salt air eliminated the practicality of steel truss bridges. The design of the bridge was similar to the rainbow arch design patented by James Barney Marsh. The bridge, along with the Ten Mile Creek Bridge and the Wilson River Bridge, was rehabilitated in 1996 to increase the overhead clearance and add a cathodic protection system to protect the embedded steel reinforcements against the corrosive air. A project to replace the cathodic protection system began in February 2014.\\n Rolla Milton Tryon Jr. (August 26, 1916 – August 20, 2001) was an American botanist who specialized in the systematics and evolution of ferns and other spore-dispersed plants (pteridology).

Then and there, I met a little woman walking all alone with a desperate indifference to what was happening around her; nobody noticed her, she noticed nobody; she was desolately alone in the unknown crowd shoving her, passing her by, heedless and hostile, leaving her to drown in the deep flood of the Avenue, inside that sea she was following, inside the wind beginning to blow. I was riveted there, the only human being who noticed her. I tried to trail after her and follow her till I could get close enough to talk to her, without my knowing what I would say to her; but by the time I \\'d made up my mind, I\\'d lost sight of her. I ran a little way ahead, stood on tiptoe in hopes of catching sight of her again, but the big black sea of people had swallowed her up. Inside me something started throbbing painfully. Without realising it, I\\'d come to a stop outside Rizzoli\\'s Bookshop and in the display window, exactly facing me, was a book about da Vinci with the Gioconda on the cover. Incredibly enigmatic, she smiled to me, automatically enlarged to the size of the woman who\\'d just disappeared down the street. I don\\'t know why all these elements became strangely tangled inside myself, together with an exquisite motif by Vivaldi, which I had heard several days before this and which had continued ever since plaguing my memory tyranically. These ten songs were composed with a blend of despair and reminiscences. The theme is a solitary woman in the big city. Each song is a monologue of hers and all the songs together compose her story. A story which is modern and, yet at the same time, old.\\n Dear Dumb Diary is a Hallmark Channel TV movie based on the book series of the same name by Jim Benton.

The genus is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. Vallisneria is a submersed plant that spreads by runners and sometimes forms tall underwater meadows. Leaves arise in clusters from their roots. The leaves have rounded tips, and definite raised veins. Single white female flowers grow to the water surface on very long stalks. Male flowers grow on short stalks, become detached, and float to the surface. The fruit is a banana-like capsule having many tiny seeds. Sometimes it is confused with the superficially similar Sagittaria when grown submerged. This plant should not be confused with Zostera species, marine seagrasses that are usually also given the common name \\\\\"eelgrass\\\\\".\\n Heinrich Zollinger (March 22, 1818 – May 19, 1859) was a Swiss botanist. Zollinger was born in Feuerthalen, Switzerland. From 1837-1838 he studied botany at the University of Geneva under Augustin and Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle, but had to interrupt his studies due to financial problems. In 1842 he moved to Java, working in a botanical garden, and on small government-financed scientific expeditions. He returned to Switzerland in 1848, but came back to Java in 1855 with his wife and two children. The species Clavaria zollingeri described scientifically by French mycologist Joseph-Henri Léveillé in 1846 was named after Heinrich Zollinger, who researched the genus Clavaria, and collected the type specimen in Java. Zollinger died in Kandangan of the long-term effects of malaria. The standard author abbreviation Zoll. is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name.\\n Acacia crassicarpa (northern wattle, thick-podded salwood, brown salwood, Papua New Guinea red wattle, red wattle; syn.

The company has been especially active in areas related to automated upmixing and downmixing of multichannel broadcast audio, and with issues related to relative loudness of broadcast audio. The company was founded in 2002 by Tim Carroll, who had previously worked as Product Manager for the Professional Audio Division of Dolby Laboratories in San Francisco. While at Dolby, Carroll contributed to the development of Dolby Digital (AC-3) and Dolby E encoding systems for DVD and high-definition television (HDTV) applications. Christina Carroll is the Vice President and Executive Director of Linear Acoustic and is responsible for managing day-to-day company operations. The company’s products can be broadly broken down into three categories: Loudness controllers designed to help television broadcasters maintain consistent audio levels; monitors and meters that measure digital audio levels, including loudness; and stand-alone encoding and transcoding products for handling the various data compression technologies commonly found in digital television plants. The subject of controlling loudness in television broadcasts has garnered considerable publicity since the FCC moved to implement enforcement of the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation or CALM Act on December 13, 2012. While consumer complaints about overly loud television commercials are almost as old as the medium itself, the CALM Act began as legislation was first sponsored by Representative Anna Eshoo, a Democratic congresswoman in California, in 2008. The law was passed in 2010 and went into full effect in 2011 and 2012. The Linear Acoustic AERO line of audio processors effectively measures and manages shifts in loudness and controls discrepancies between program and commercial audio without unnecessarily degrading the quality of the audio or significantly affecting the dynamic range that adds impact to digital television audio. When used in combination with a meter capable of measuring loudness by the ITU-R BS.1770 standard (or derivatives of this standard, such as EBU R128) U.S. broadcasters will be able to achieve CALM compliance by effectively managing and monitoring audio levels. Linear Acoustic also manufacturers the UPMAX 5.1-channel upmixer, which creates multi-channel surround sound audio from 2-channel (stereo) sources. NBC utilized this product during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, and relied upon the company’s AERO.qc products during the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. In 2008, Linear Acoustic became part of The Telos Alliance, based in Cleveland, Ohio. The Telos Alliance comprises Telos Systems, Axia Audio, Omnia Audio, and 25-Seven Systems that manufacture broadcast telephone systems, consoles and audio over IP gear, audio processors, and audio time management hardware for radio stations. Frank Foti, founder of Omnia Audio, is The Telos Alliance CEO. At the 2012 NAB Show in Las Vegas, Linear Acoustic announced a co-branding agreement with Dolby Laboratories under which the company will manufacture stand-alone Dolby-centric professional products such as audio codecs and audio bitstream test tools.\\n Derrick Rshone Johnson (born 6 January 1985) is a American male weightlifter, competing in the 62 kg category and representing United States at international competitions.

The film is a comedy of manners that depicts members of upper-class French society and their servants just before the beginning of World War II, showing their moral callousness on the eve of impending destruction. The Rules of the Game was the most expensive French film up to that time, with its original budget of 2.5 million francs increased to over five million. When directing the film, Renoir and cinematographer Jean Bachelet made use of deep-focus cinematography and long shots during which the camera is constantly moving, both sophisticated cinematic techniques in 1939. Renoir\\'s career in France was at its pinnacle in 1939 and The Rules of the Game was eagerly anticipated; however, its premiere was met with scorn and disapproval by both critics and audiences. Renoir reduced the film\\'s running time from 113 minutes to 85, but even then the film was a critical and financial disaster. In October 1939, it was banned by the wartime French government for \\\\\"having an undesirable influence over the young.\\\\\" For many years, the 85-minute version was the only one available, but despite this its reputation slowly grew. In 1956, boxes of original material were rediscovered and a reconstructed version of the film premiered that year at the Venice Film Festival, with only a minor scene from Renoir\\'s first cut missing. Since then, The Rules of the Game has often been called one of the greatest films in the history of cinema.

He devised a method for classifying fingerprints that proved useful in forensic science. He also conducted research on the power of prayer, concluding it had none by its null effects on the longevity of those prayed for.

Born in Măgureni, Prahova County, he was trained as an aeronautical engineer. He claimed to have devised over a hundred inventions, although a search revealed only two patents in his name. Machines on which he worked included 72 fuel-efficient cars, 15 unconventional engines and seven aircraft. He reported that as early as 1949-1950, he built a motor that would respond to verbal commands. A 1955 two-wheel automobile, which he dubbed the Virgilius, used an airplane motor, reached 300 km/hour and weighed 250 kg. One of his cars, which he called the Soleta and which he modeled in 1973, was unusually small. It consumed 0.5 liters of gasoline per 100 km. Later, he continued developing prototypes for battery-powered motors, with a particular focus on increased efficiency and decreased weight. Perhaps his most notorious claim is to have invented the jet pack. According to an interview he gave, he proposed this device to the Romanian Academy in 1956 and completed it in 1958. When the Academy declined to show interest, he offered it to the American Embassy, which was also uninterested. He was then jailed by the Communist regime for having approached the embassy. He claimed to have flown the device and received a patent in 1958. Although he later showed photographs of a device, he was unable to prove when he built it, whether he flew it or when the photographs were taken. He never explained how he learned to fly his device, how long he stayed airborne, how many times he flew it, or why there is no contemporary documentation of the flight. Nevertheless, in Romania alone, his claim to have invented the jet pack is widely believed. While Capră undoubtedly built two jet pack-like devices, the second one dated from the mid-1960s, and he claimed that as the groundbreaking model. At the same time, he admitted his 1958 design did not work. Still, he claimed that an American design for a jet pack only appeared in 1962, four years after his own. However, one team from Bell Laboratories applied for a patent in 1960, while another, from Thompson Ramo Woolridge in Ohio, filed in 1958, the same year Capră said he filed in Romania. Despite the shakiness of Capră\\'s assertions, it is widely accepted in Romania that at least one of his jet packs was flown before Bell\\'s. Additionally, many Romanian sources on Capră state that \\\\\"the Americans\\\\\" stole his design. What likely transpired is that Capră\\' who had no independent evidence he built anything before 1967, saw the Bell model fly and copied it. This second model is in a museum in Bucharest, although he probably never flew it. Late in life, he began to state that he beat Bell by two years. A resident of Filipeștii de Pădure in his later years, he died in Ploiești.\\n Akbarabad (Persian: اكبراباد\\u200e\\u200e, also Romanized as Akbarābād) is a village in Khezel-e Sharqi Rural District, Khezel District, Nahavand County, Hamadan Province, Iran.

Later it was renamed as the Phillip R. Shriver Center, and provided space for not just the student body at the University, but also for faculty, staff and the greater Oxford community. Today the student body is triple the size it was 50 years ago when the University Center first opened. Although the building is still a cornerstone of the Miami University Campus, due to high demand from the community and severe limitations on space, there is little room left for students. Therefore a new student union building, the Armstrong Student Center was built, located diagonally across from the Shriver Center, in the heart of Miami University’s campus. Miami University\\'s Student Shriver Center wasn’t built and allowed for public use until 1957. It was originally known as the University Center and was made as a center designed specifically for students after World War II. Prior to this being built, the students did not have a center dedicated specifically to them. The closest thing the student body had for recreational purposes – other than a gym – was what was known as the Miami’s Redskin Reservation, which was simply a dining hall. After World War II, students petitioned for a center for themselves.\\n The Soldiers of Pancho Villa (Spanish: La Cucaracha) is a 1959 Mexican epic historical drama film co-written, produced, and directed by Ismael Rodríguez, inspired by the popular Mexican Revolution corrido \\\\\"La Cucaracha\\\\\".

The genus consists of pioneer trees in the more or less humid parts of the Neotropics, with the majority of the species being myrmecophytic. Berg and Rosselli state that the genus is characterized by some unusual traits: spathes fully enclosing the flower-bearing parts of the inflorescences until anthesis, patches of dense indumentums (trichilia) producing Mullerian (food) at the base of the petiole, and anthers becoming detached at anthesis. Cecropia is most studied for its ecological role and association with ants. Its classification is controversial; in the past it has been placed in the Cecropiaceae, Moraceae (the mulberry family), or Urticaceae (the nettle family). The modern Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system places the \\\\\"cecropiacean\\\\\" group in the Urticaceae. The genus is native to the American tropics, where it is one of the most recognizable components of the rainforest. The genus is named after Cecrops I, the mythical first king of Athens. Common local names include yarumo or yagrumo, or more specifically yagrumo hembra (\\\\\"female yagrumo\\\\\") to distinguish them from the similar-looking but unrelated Schefflera (which are called yagrumo macho, \\\\\"male yagrumo\\\\\"). In English, these trees are occasionally called pumpwoods (though this may also refer to C. schreberiana specifically) or simply Cecropias. Spanish-speaking countries in Central American, Mexico, the Caribbean, Colombia and Ecuador commonly use the vernacular name, “guarumo”.\\n Wonderlustre is the fourth studio album by the British rock band Skunk Anansie.

He was accused of, and subsequently proven to have cheated on his trans-America record attempt in 2016. Outside Magazine has written an article about his deceit, as has The Guardian. His former sponsor, SKINS, launched an independent investigation into his cheating. This investigation \\'found ‘no alternative plausible explanation’ than Young received unauthorised assistance, riding in his support vehicle for much of the early part of the \\'run\\'.\\'. Following the report, Young was dropped by SKINS as a sponsor, and as an Ambassador for charity Dreams Come True. Many of his other claims, including to have been a triathlon champion, a professional cyclist and to have completed a host of self-styled ultra-running feats are unsubstantiated and have been called into question by independent observers.\\n Talk a Good Game is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Kelly Rowland. Formerly titled Year of the Woman, the album was released on June 14, 2013 through Universal Republic and its affiliated record labels. Incorporating a base core of R&B and pop music, Talk a Good Game was influenced by the likes of Whitney Houston, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder amongst other of Rowland\\'s idols. Rowland wanted the album to be a celebration of womanhood and referred to the record as her most personal album to date. On the album, she co-wrote all but one song, \\\\\"Freak\\\\\", a cover of the same 2010 song by entertainer Jamie Foxx from his fourth studio album Best Night of My Life. A deluxe edition, and Target-exclusive edition of the album featuring bonus tracks, was released simultaneously alongside the twelve-track standard edition. Talk a Good Game was promoted with live renditions of the album\\'s songs during the Lights Out Tour, a co-headline concert tour between Rowland and The-Dream. The album was also preceded by the release of the lead single, a Mike Will Made It and Marz production called \\\\\"Kisses Down Low\\\\\" which peaked in the top-thirty of the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. A second single, The-Dream-produced \\\\\"Dirty Laundry\\\\\", was released a month before the album and documents Rowland\\'s initial jealousy of the success Beyoncé attained in her solo career following the release of her debut album Dangerously in Love (2003); the song also talks about the domestic abuse that Rowland suffered during a previous relationship. Upon its release, music critics commended the album\\'s cohesive sound and themes throughout, often noting Rowland\\'s most personal and vulnerable lyrics as well as the strength of her vocals. Talk a Good Game debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 selling 68,000 copies in its opening week, becoming Rowland\\'s third top ten album. The album also debuted at number four on the US R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart, failing to match the number one peak that her last album, Here I Am (2011), reached. In 2014, Rowland parted ways with her label, wanting a new start elsewhere and signalling the end of the Talk a Good Game era; the album was her only release under Republic Records.\\n Pembine High School is a high school in Pembine, Wisconsin.

Henry Deacon\\'s father was also named Henry Deacon and his mother was Esther Deacon, his father\\'s cousin. The family were members of the Sandemanian church, one of whose members, Michael Faraday, was a friend of the Deacon family. Faraday played an important part in the development of Henry junior\\'s life and development. His education was at a Quaker school in Tottenham. He was apprenticed at the age of 14 to the London engineering firm of Galloway & Sons. When this company failed, he joined the business of Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company in their factory at Patricroft, Manchester, on the banks of the Bridgewater Canal. In the 1840s he moved to Pilkington Brothers at St Helens and became manager of their glass-polishing department. While he was there he invented an apparatus for the grinding and smoothing of glass. In 1851 he left to join John Hutchinson, alkali manufacturer, in Widnes. In 1853 Deacon, with Edmond Leyland, filed his first patent, which was for an improved manufacturing process for sulphuric acid. Later that year Deacon left Hutchinson and went into partnership with the younger of the Pilkington brothers, William, to establish their own alkali works in Widnes on land between the Sankey Canal and St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway. This partnership was dissolved in 1855. In a new partnership with his previous employer, Holbrook Gaskell who provided the capital, the firm of Gaskell, Deacon and Co was founded. At that time all factories manufacturing alkali were doing so by the Leblanc process. In 1838 Harrison Grey Dyar and John Henmming patented an ammonia-soda process of making alkali. Deacon experimented with this process but had no success and Gaskell persuaded him to abandon this project. Between 1854 and 1876 Deacon, alone or in collaboration with others, filed at least 29 patents, all relating to alkali manufacture. Deacon also presented a number of papers to learned societies, including the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1870, the Chemical Society in 1870 and the Warrington Literary and Philosophical Society in 1874. In 1867 Deacon took on a chemist, Ferdinand Hurter, on a month\\'s probation. In time Hurter was to become the chief chemist to the company. Deacon worked with him to discover an improved method of manufacturing chlorine from hydrochloric acid, a noxious by-product of the Leblanc process, and in 1870 discovered a better process, using copper chloride as a catalyst. Henry Deacon also played a part in public life in Widnes. He was chairman of the Local Board and played a significant part in establishing the waterworks at Pex Hill. He was chairman of the first school board in the town. Deacon married Emma Wade from Basford, Nottingham in 1851 with whom he had two sons and a daughter. After Emma\\'s death he married Caroline Rutt of Islington, Middlesex, in 1866. Deacon died in 1876 from typhoid fever at his home in Widnes. He was survived by his widow, seven sons and four daughters. His estate was in excess of £100,000.\\n Hamm AG is a German worldwide manufacturer and marketer of road rollers based in Tirschenreuth, Germany. It is a subsidiary of Wirtgen Group. Brothers Anton and Franz Hamm, who were gunsmiths, founded the company in 1878 to build agricultural equipment. The company built their first diesel-powered road roller in 1911, from a design by a second-generation Hamm, Hans Hamm. This was at a time when most rollers where steam powered. In 1928 the company abandoned all other product lines to concentrate on road rollers. Hamm produces the first all-wheel drive-all-wheel steering double-drum, tandem roller and soil compactor with vibration(Unbalance mass principle) in 1932, and retains patent protection rights until 1970. The company introduced an all-wheel steering and all-wheel drive rubber-wheeled roller in 1963, and then rolled out its oscillating vibratory roller in 1989.

Ayres. Over the years its Indianapolis flagship store, which opened in 1905 and was later enlarged, became known for its women’s fashions, the Tea Room, holiday events and displays, and the basement budget store. As urban populations shifted to the suburbs, Ayres established branch stores in new shopping centers in several Indiana cities. Ayres also acquired retail subsidiaries in Springfield, Illinois; Fort Wayne, Indiana; and Louisville, Kentucky. Ayr-Way, the Ayres discount store subsidiary, became one of the first discount store divisions launched by a traditional store. By the end of the 1960s Ayres had become a diversified merchandising business with retail department stores, a chain of discount stores, specialty clothing stores, a home furnishings showroom, and a real estate holding company. A long-time Ayres slogan, \\\\\"That Ayres Look\\\\\", promoted the company as a fashion leader and by 1972 it had become the oldest continuous retail slogan in the United States. Associated Dry Goods acquired Ayres in 1972. After The May Company acquired Associated Dry Goods in 1986, several Ayres stores were closed. The flagship store in Indianapolis was closed in the spring of 1992 as the remaining Ayres operation merged with May\\'s Famous-Barr division. Federated Department Stores, owner of rival Macy\\'s, acquired The May Company on August 30, 2005. On February 1, 2006, L. S. Ayres was dissolved and folded into the newly-formed Macy\\'s Midwest division. On September 9, 2006, the L. S. Ayres name was retired as most stores were converted to Macy\\'s.

It won an Academy Award at the 19th Academy Awards in 1947 for Best Short Subject (Two-Reel). Short-story author Samuel A. Derieux who died twenty-four years earlier, in 1922, received story credit for the film, suggesting to some the expectation that he wrote a work with the title \\\\\"A Boy and His Dog\\\\\". However, a plot summary for the film, attributed to David Glagovsky, closely parallels Derieux\\'s short story \\\\\"The Trial in Tom Belcher\\'s Store\\\\\", suggesting the film-makers drew on the published (and once celebrated) story, but gave the film a title Derieux need not ever have considered.\\n Paphiopedilum urbanianum is a species of plant in the Orchidaceae family.

The Italian title translates as A God Called Dorian. Directed by Massimo Dallamano and produced by Harry Alan Towers, the film stresses the decadence and eroticism of the story and changes the setting to early 1970s London. The sexual liberation of the late 1960s and early 1970s provides a fitting backdrop for Dorian\\'s escapades in this version, and also the general clothing and fashion style of the era is extrapolated into a 1970s version of the aesthetic, decadent world of the 1890s novel. Critical opinion of the film is decidedly mixed. On the one hand, some consider the film trash and sexploitation, while others point out that the film was shot at a unique time in the 20th century when a new openness about sexuality and its depiction on film allowed showing scenes only vaguely hinted at in the novel and earlier (and also later) movie adaptations. It\\'s interesting to contemplate how this film would\\'ve turned out if it had been directed by Jesus Franco, since in 1970, Franco was turning out several films for producer Towers, and this film featured a number of the actors Franco and Towers were working with at the time (Marie Liljedahl, Herbert Lom, Maria Rohm, etc.). Franco was probably too busy filming Count Dracula at the time to direct Dorian Gray as well. A marked difference between this version and the novel is the final scene. Instead of Dorian slicing the painting with the knife (thereby inadvertently killing himself), he is seen committing suicide with the knife deliberately.\\n Barnstable High School is a public high school (grades 8–12) in the village of Hyannis, Massachusetts, United States, Town of Barnstable.

It was built to house knights of the Order of Saint John from the langues of Auvergne and Provence. Auberge d\\'Auvergne et Provence was built in the 1530s, incorporating earlier buildings. Parts of the ground floor and basement are believed to date back to the 15th century, while older remains possibly date back to the Byzantine period. The auberge is reported to have been functional by 1531, and its existence is confirmed by the Order\\'s records in August 1532. The auberge was originally built as two separate auberges, with Auvergne on the right and Provence on the left. At some point, these were joined together and shared a single façade. The building formed a compact block with other auberges next to it, namely Auberge d\\'Aragon and Auberge de France. The façade consists of a central doorway, with smaller doors on each side. The central doorway is embellished with a moulded cornice. The apertures have typical Melitan mouldings. The auberge continued to house the langues of Auvergne and Provence until the building of a separate Auberge d\\'Auvergne and Auberge de Provence in Valletta in the 1570s and 1580s. The building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925, together with the other auberges in Birgu. In the years before World War II, the right side of the building was partially demolished to make way for a modern residence. After the war, the remaining part of the auberge was divided into separate houses and a shop, and the structure was modified by the addition of a timber balcony.

S. Perera QC (UNP Member Colombo North) named \\\\\"Ceylon Insurance Co.\\\\\" listed late 1938-39.Due to the latter\\'s political stance against the SLFP political partys divisive \\\\\"Sinhala Only Act\\\\\" Ceylon Insurance Co. was eventually politically persuaded to relinquish control by the then SLFP government of Mrs. Bandaranayake to Senator Justin Kotalawela then on the board of Ceylon Insurance. Justin Kotelawala gained control of Ceylon Insurance Co. from Mrs. Alice Farmacia Perera widow of Cyril E. S. Perera and from Mrs. Violet van Dort widow of Hugh Weerasekere. Many people at the time were under the impression Ceylon Insurance Co. was not a profitable company due to what people were led to believe, when, in fact, Ceylon Insurance Co. was and still is a significant player in Sri Lanka\\'s economy. Cyril E. S. Perera also co-founded (with the Berenger family) another significant Sri Lankan company named KANDOS, which he named after the city where they first produced chocolate bars, in combination with the Latin word for money \\\\\"dos\\\\\". Kandos also went under the same SLFP reformation, control eventually going into the hands of Upali Wijewardana for no monetary value.

In 1901 the company was folded into the International Mercantile Marine shipping trust (IMM). The line developed with railroad support as an offshoot of Bernard N. Baker\\'s Baltimore Storage and Lighterage Company in 1881. Although American owned, the Atlantic Transport Line operated from Britain, with British registered and manned vessels, most of which were British built. General cargo, live cattle and small numbers of passengers were carried from Baltimore and Philadelphia to British ports and the line developed an excellent reputation for shipping valuable horses. A full-scale weekly passenger service between New York and London commenced in 1892 and today the line is best remembered for its exclusively first class direct London to New York passenger/cargo service operated by its four Minne class ships, SS Minneapolis, SS Minnehaha, SS Minnetonka and SS Minnewaska from 1900 to 1915. In 1898 the U.S. Government bought seven of the Line\\'s ten ships for use as military transports in the Spanish–American War (Baker lent another for use as a hospital ship). The line survived this potentially devastating blow because Baker pulled off a sensational deal and bought a British competitor\\'s five brand new ships almost immediately as replacements. The Atlantic Transport Company of West Virginia was formed at this time to assert American ownership of the line\\'s overseas assets. Baker\\'s attempt to sell the line to British owners in the late 1890s sparked the chain of events that lead to the formation of the IMM. The line\\'s most important ships were all sunk during the First World War. After the war four huge replacements for the Minne class ships were planned. Only two of these were built however and the passenger service, which recommenced in 1923, never matched pre-war successes. With first class travel declining the A.T.L. introduced a tourist third class ship in 1925 and for two seasons operated a second. But the line was faltering even before the Wall Street Crash and with the recession of 1931 its remaining ships were laid up or transferred to other IMM lines and it effectively ceased to exist. The American holding company survived until 1936. The SS Minnewaska was the last ship the Atlantic Transport Line operated.\\n Mamorallo Tjoka (born 25 October 1984 in Ha Seqhoe, Malehloana, Lesotho) is a Basotho long-distance runner who competed in the marathon event at the 2012 Summer Olympics.She was the flag bearer of Lesotho during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.\\n Mazraeh-ye Pagondeh (Persian: مزرعه پاگنده\\u200e\\u200e, also Romanized as Mazra‘eh-ye Pāgondeh; also known as Pā Gandeh, Pāgondeh, and Pa Gundeh) is a village in Aqda Rural District, Aqda District, Ardakan County, Yazd Province, Iran.

Its common names include Indian camphorweed, Indian fleabane, and Indian pluchea. It is native to parts of Asia and Australia, and it is widespread in the Pacific Islands as an introduced and often invasive species. This species is a branching shrub up to 2 meters tall. The toothed oval leaf blades are papery but not thin, and often have a fine coating of hairs. The flower heads grow in dense clusters in the leaf axils and at the branch tips. The pinkish purple florets have long, protruding styles. Florets along the edges of the head produce fruits. The fruit body is a millimeter in length with a white pappus about 5 millimeters long. The seeds are dispersed on the wind. The plant often grows in wet saline coastal habitat, such as brackish marshes and mangroves. Though it is not very competitive with other flora, it can easily colonize coastal habitat and impact native and cultivated plants. It alters waterbird habitat. The species hybridizes with Pluchea carolinensis when the two plants grow together, yielding a hybrid that has been named Pluchea × fosbergii. The plant contains the compounds β-sitosterol and stigmasterol, which have antidiabetic properties. The β-sitosterol isolated from the root extract can also neutralize the venom of Russell\\'s viper (Daboia russelii) and the monocled cobra (Naja kaouthia).\\n Here It Comes EP is a release by Luke Vibert under the alias Plug.

It was certified gold on April 11, 1991. Produced by Bob Rock, the album featured the lead guitar work of Jason Becker, a then up-and-coming guitarist who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, aka Lou Gehrig\\'s Disease) a week after joining the band. He managed to finish recording the album, but was unable to tour in support of the album, as his condition left him with little strength in his hands. The profile of the album was initially increased by the controversy surrounding the promotional music video released for the album\\'s first single, \\\\\"A Lil\\' Ain\\'t Enough\\\\\"; featuring barely dressed women and oddly dressed little people, the video was banned from MTV shortly after its initial airing. A second single and video was released for the song \\\\\"Sensible Shoes\\\\\" but airplay on MTV was limited secondary to the provocative nature of the video. The album is seen as the beginning of Roth\\'s commercial decline, as there was a drop-off in sales from his prior two albums. Timing is seen as a factor in the album not selling as successfully as his prior works. Within a year of the album\\'s release, the Seattle grunge movement had created a sea-change in rock, and Roth\\'s brand of hard rock was considered, by mainstream audiences, as obsolete. Still, A Little Ain\\'t Enough is something of a fan favorite and many view it as his most under appreciated album. Although the album went out of print on the Warner Bros. label in 1996, it was later reissued (in remastered form) in 2007 through the Friday Music label.\\n Black Sabbath: The Dio Years is a 2007 compilation CD of material from recordings made during vocalist Ronnie James Dio\\'s tenure in the band. The CD contains full album length, remastered tracks culled from all three studio albums: Heaven and Hell (1980), Mob Rules (1981), Dehumanizer (1992), and the live album Live Evil (1982). It also contains three new recorded songs: \\\\\"The Devil Cried\\\\\", \\\\\"Shadow of the Wind\\\\\", and \\\\\"Ear in the Wall\\\\\". It was reported that the collection was first conceived of as a box set, in the vein of Black Box: The Complete Original Black Sabbath (1970–1978), containing all of the group\\'s albums released from their post–Ozzy Osbourne period, starting from Heaven and Hell to The Eternal Idol. This idea was eventually scrapped, and another box set was planned only to feature the four albums recorded from the Dio era of the band. This second idea was put aside, eventually emerging into The Rules of Hell box set released in the summer of 2008. In an interview conducted by Martin Popoff, Tony Iommi revealed that in fact three tracks were recorded: \\\\\"Shadow of the Wind\\\\\" (a slow tune), \\\\\"The Devil Cried\\\\\" (a mid-tempo rocker) and \\\\\"Ear in the Wall\\\\\" (a fast song), therefore changing the original plan for two new songs to accommodate all three tracks in the compilation. \\\\\"The Devil Cried\\\\\" was released as a single on 13 March 2007. On 23 February 2007, both Eddie Trunk and Sirius Satellite Radio unveiled the song \\\\\"The Devil Cried\\\\\" from the upcoming album. Rhino Records subsequently made the track available (for preview only) on 26 February 2007. On the week of 13 March 2007, it became available for download at all digital outlets. After the recording was completed the members decided to tour under the moniker Heaven & Hell. Dio and Iommi decided that the working partnership they had achieved in recording the 3 new songs would not be wasted, so they recorded The Devil You Know.\\n Gold Mine in the Sky is a 1938 Western film directed by Joseph Kane and starring Gene Autry, Smiley Burnette, and Carol Hughes.

It was released as a \\\\\"long box\\\\\" box set in 1994 and re-released in a jewel box size in 1998. The two-CD set contains recordings from V-Discs that were sent to troops during World War II. The V-Discs were the only recordings that the musician\\'s union allowed Sinatra to record during the session musicians strike between 1942 and 1944 and he took full advantage, knowing that although the records would not be sold, it would keep him in the public ear, and allow him to perfect his technique. Although a heavy set, it does not contain every V-disc Sinatra recorded. A more complete set would not become available until 2003 with the release of The Real Complete Columbia Years V-Discs.\\n Toowoomba South State School was a primary school located in South Toowoomba in Queensland, Australia.

Hibiscus calycinus, Hibiscus chrysantha, Hibiscus chrysanthus, Hibiscus rockii) is a shrub from tropical Africa belonging to the Hibiscus genus. In 1883 this Hibiscus was offered for sale in England under the name Hibiscus chrysanthus with Port Natal, Cape Colony (now South Africa), identified as the source. By 1891 the same Hibiscus was identified as Hibiscus chrysantha in the United States, a practice which may have continued into the 1930s and contributed to incorrect species identification. In 1892 the name Hibiscus calycinus was designated as the correct name for the species; but, by 1894 the currently accepted name Hibiscus calyphyllus is found in association with Hibiscus calycinus. At the beginning of the 20th century, this Hibiscus was sold as seeds in the United States under the name Hibiscus Giant Yellow. Because of the similarity of the flowers, it is quite common to find Abelmoschus manihot confused with Hibiscus calyphyllus in the early 20th century gardening literature of the United States, particularly in the area of cold tolerance. If the species identification is correct, the 1903 report in The Flower Garden states that: \\\\\"Giant Yellow is a beautiful canary yellow with crimson throat, hardy as far north as St. Louis, but safer in the cellar above that latitude\\\\\", then Hibiscus calyphyllus may have some degree of cold tolerance. St. Louis, Missouri is in USDA Zone 6a but there are currently no reports of Hibiscus calyphyllus overwintering in USDA Zone 6a; it is known to overwinter successfully in USDA Zone 8a. Hibiscus calyphyllus grows to 1-1.8 meters (3–6 feet) tall. It has flowers which grow to 8–10 cm (3–4 in) wide, with a yellow color and a brownish center. Unlike many African Hibiscus, which are fall to late-fall bloomers, Hibiscus calyphyllus is a summer bloomer which means it can be grown in many locations in North American and Europe and produce viable seeds, which are easy to collect and germinate. If the seeds are started indoors early in February or March, Hibiscus calyphyllus will bloom the first year. Hibiscus calyphyllus is a day-bloomer with the flowers opening several hours after sunrise and closing several hours before sunset. No hybrids of Hibiscus calyphyllus have been reported but it is interesting to note that Hibiscus syriacus and Hibiscus calyphyllus have identical diploid chromosome counts of 80. The plant is used in the construction of huts by the Maasai people of Kenya.\\n Kohneh Deh (Persian: كهنه ده\\u200e\\u200e) is a village in Tavabe-e Kojur Rural District, Kojur District, Nowshahr County, Mazandaran Province, Iran.

After serving in World War I he took a position at Washington University in St. Louis until, in 1923, he was appointed to the chair of anatomy at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. Ten years later he was appointed to the chair at Yale University. At Missouri, he began his studies of sex hormones. While it was commonly believed at the time that the female reproductive cycle was controlled by substance in the corpus luteum, Allen sought the answer in the follicles surrounding the ovum, leading to his discovery of estrogen, though it was identified six years later by Adolf Butenandt in 1929. Allen died of a heart attack in 1943 while on duty with the United States Coast Guard.\\n Only the Valiant, also known as Fort Invincible, is a 1951 western film produced by William Cagney (younger brother of James Cagney), directed by Gordon Douglas and starring Gregory Peck and Barbara Payton.

According to Anger, the film takes the name \\\\\"pleasure dome\\\\\" from Samuel Taylor Coleridge\\'s atmospheric poem Kubla Khan. Anger was inspired to make the film after attending a Halloween party called \\\\\"Come as your Madness.\\\\\" The film has gained cult film status. Early prints of the film had sequences that were meant to be projected on three different screens. Anger subsequently re-edited the film to layer the images. The film—primarily the 2nd and 3rd revisions—was often shown in American universities and art galleries during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

In the late 1970s, a third revision was made, which was The Sacred Mushroom Edition re-edited to fit the Electric Light Orchestra album Eldorado, omitting only \\\\\"Illusions in G Major,\\\\\" a blues-rock tune which Anger felt did not fit the mood of the film.

Known in ancient times as Apheca or Afeka, the word can be interpreted as \\\\\"source\\\\\", is located in the mountains of Lebanon, about 20 kilometres from the ancient city of Byblos, which still stands just east of the town of Qartaba. It is the site of one of the finest waterfalls in the mountains of the Middle East, which feeds into the Adonis River (known today as Abraham River or Nahr Ibrahim in Arabic), and forms Lake Yammoune, with which it is also associated by legend.

As its title indicates, Transition was a bridge between classic quartet recordings like A Love Supreme and the more experimental works of Coltrane\\'s last years. For some reason, Impulse! decided to alter the track listing of the original album on the CD edition, removing \\\\\"Dear Lord\\\\\" and replacing it with two pieces originally released on Kulu Sé Mama, both recorded on June 10: \\\\\"Welcome\\\\\" and \\\\\"Vigil\\\\\". However, the 2001 Japanese edition restored the original track listing. Coltrane\\'s playing alternates between blues idioms and the free jazz that would dominate his final work. Of the four musicians on this album, pianist McCoy Tyner was still the most grounded in traditional jazz. Bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones were finding new ways to approach their instruments, while Coltrane took the lead with a newfound musical freedom. Transition\\'s title track is a fifteen-minute modified blues, whilst \\\\\"Dear Lord\\\\\" is a ballad featuring Roy Haynes substituting for Jones on drums. \\\\\"Welcome,\\\\\" which replaces \\\\\"Dear Lord\\\\\" on the album\\'s compact disc release, is a five-minute ballad with a theme pitched high in the tenor saxophone\\'s altissimo register and making extensive use of multiphonics. The closing \\\\\"Suite\\\\\" is a twenty-minute performance, covering a variety of moods. \\\\\"Vigil\\\\\", which concludes the CD release of the album, is a fiery duet between Coltrane and Jones. Two months after this recording, Coltrane\\'s quartet moved further into experimental territory with the album Sun Ship.\\n DDC-I, Inc. is a privately held company providing software development of real-time operating systems, software development tools, and software services for safety-critical embedded applications, headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona.

Two or three flowers are found on each stem, which is of variable height, ranging from 15–80 centimeters (5.9–31.5 in) tall.

The company was originally incorporated in California. According to company literature, the company\\'s cats have significantly reduced levels of a particular protein that humans suffer allergic reactions to. The journal Nature reported in September 2006 that in an Allerca-funded study, Sheldon Spector, a clinical allergy expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, found the company\\'s cats to be less allergy-inducing than the control. However, neither the study nor its underlying data have been published, and Spector himself advises caution as regards his study\\'s interpretation as he used an experimental setup that is generally regarded as less than reliable. A July 2006 article in the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that no details about the cats have been released, nor have there been any peer-reviewed studies published about the company\\'s work. Cat experts also questioned whether the company\\'s breeding model - stated at the time to be up to 10,000 cats by 2009 - was viable.

Allerca refuses to provide its kittens to clients whose allergy test results \\\\\"indicate a level that includes HIGH\\\\\". A cat based on the Domestic shorthair cost US$6,950 while ones based on the Siamese and Ashera cost $16,900 and $26,950 respectively.

Allerca settled. The settlement agreed that Allerca would not re-enter the genetically engineered allergen free cat market until May 31, 2006. For a while, Allerca offered a franchising program, possibly in violation of California law. Reports from Allerca indicate that they accepted at least partial payment from potential franchisees. The company announced that on January 1, 2010 they will cease their breeding activities. However, their website remains active, and recent online complaints suggest that they are still in business. A report by ABC news in July 2013  confirms that the cats sold by Lifestyle Pets are no more hypoallergenic than any other cat.\\n Banksia is a genus of around 170 species in the plant family Proteaceae.

Ltd. was a consulting engineering firm based in Canada and the United States that operated from 1960 to 2005. In the late 1950s James Keen, in association with Jerry Yost of Toronto, formed Yost Keen and Associates. The company successfully designed many projects in Toronto. They began to build a solid reputation within the consulting engineering industry that started bringing projects from Western Canada. One of the Western projects obtained by the firm was located in Regina, Saskatchewan. In order to successfully complete this project, the partners decided that an office needed to be set up in Regina. Jim Keen opened the Regina office. By 1960 the two partners agreed to split into two firms, and the Regina office became Keen Engineering Co. Ltd. James Keen and the principals of the newly formed Keen Engineering decided to aggressively pursue the growing Western Canadian market. After conducting a careful analysis of the building services market, the Directors decided to open offices in Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver.

James Keen died in 2000, but the company name lived on. Kevin Hydes was appointed president of Keen in 1998. Under Kevin\\'s guidance, Keen Engineering quickly became a leader in the field of green engineering. This quickly led to the formation of Keengreen - a division of Keen that focused exclusively on Green design. This group promoted sustainable design across the entire company so effectively that green design became the company\\'s philosophy. As a result of this new policy, Keen became a world leader in sustainable building design, having over 160 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) accredited professionals on staff by 2005, the most of any organization in the world. In May 2000, Keen expanded its North American operations by opening an office in Seattle, Washington, and later on in San Francisco.

Over 3 million patients world-wide, mostly with cancer, have been treated with Neupogen. G-CSF mobilizes stem cells from the bone marrow into the circulation and subsequent peripheral blood leukapheresis produces sufficient stem cells for both autologous or allogeneic transplantation, reducing the need to obtain large volumes of bone marrow. Such stem cell transplants give a faster recovery of white blood cells, platelets and red cells than seen with conventional bone marrow transplantation. G-CSF stem cell transplants are used in treatment of leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma resulting in prolonged remission and, in some cases, cure.
